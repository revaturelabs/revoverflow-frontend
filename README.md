# RevOverflow

RevOverflow is a site dedicated to providing support to technical problems encountered by the Revature community during training and project work. This platform is intended to provide a positive, constructive location to seek help from the Revature community regarding challenges that developers frequently face. It also helps facilitate transfer of knowledge between associates and batches, helps document and solve common problems, and provides a mechanism for associates to gain knowledge by helping one another. RevOverflow integrates with the Revature Swag Shop to provide the opportunity for participants to earn rewards.

## Usage
Our application utilizes a storefront API which communicates using RESTful conventions with our backend, which is hosted on AWS's (Amazon Web Services) EC2 servers. In turn - our backend utilizes Hibernate and STS (Spring Tool Suite) to communicate with a PostgreSQL RDS we also host on AWS.
All this comes together in our frontend which is built using React. Our two distinct API's meet here and communicate through standard HTTP protocols. We encrypt all our users logins as well as ensure all endpoints are distinct and cannot be compromised.
